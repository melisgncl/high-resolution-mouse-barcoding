## Dynamic Covariance Mapping (DCM) Framework

The Dynamic Covariance Mapping (DCM) introduces a parameter-free methodology for estimating the community interaction matrix directly from abundance time-series data of microbial community members. This framework is designed to address the complexity of microbial interactions in their natural environments where multiple species interactions and intra-species diversity significantly influence the community dynamics.

To estimate the community interaction matrix and analyze stability changes across different phases using Dynamic Covariance Mapping (DCM), simply execute the following script:src/general_DCM.R
