######################This is for determining the clone dynamics###########################

##this is ploting cluster treshold between range 0.1-0.9 and check to see which threshold gvies better information###

  
condition.list file lists the prefixes of mice cohorts(im,gf,rm)
other .list files contain the mouse samples per cohort (im1,im2,im3, etc.)

Executes the first 5 steps in the clustering pipeline:

1. Filtering the data based on the number of non-zero barcodes
2. Computing the correlation matrix for filtered barcodes
3. Plotting and flattening dendrogram into clusters
4. Plotting clusters depending on treshold and extracting loess fits
5. Calculating the smallest distance between two loess within the cluster depending on treshold and choose the treshold based on that.

############ execClustering2.sh ###########

6.Depending on choosen treshold choose your clones

7. 6_cluster_of_clusters.R: Clustering all loess fits for each group of mice to see their dynamic similarity

8. 7_cluster_similarity.R : Use this R code to compute the pairwise overlap between clusters for each group of mice and check their significance with z-score simulation.
